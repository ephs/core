# Core
### A redesign of Eden Prairie High School's Core
![Login Page](/img/login.png)
This redesign of Core fixes the old, ugly, default Core page and replaces it with a pretty and modern look. The login page at https://ephs.github.io/core is fully functional, but due to the limitations of cross site scripting will log you in to the deafult website. The landing page mockup is only a demo. You can check it out [here](https://ephs.github.io/core/landing.html).

Erik Duxstad (@eduxstad) and Avery Bartnik (@Jythonscript) created this prototype.
