[![Login Page](/img/login.png)](https://ephs.github.io/core)

This redesign of Core fixes the old, ugly, default Core page and replaces it with a more modern look. The login page at https://ephs.github.io/core is fully functional, but due to the limitations of cross site scripting will log you in to the default website. The landing page mockup is only a demo. You can check that out [here](https://ephs.github.io/core/landing.html).

Erik Duxstad ([@eduxstad](https://github.com/eduxstad)) and Avery Bartnik ([@Jythonscript](https://github.com/Jythonscript)) created this prototype.
